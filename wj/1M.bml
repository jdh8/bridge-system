We play Untwisted 2/1 over 1!s.  The 2/1 bids are either natural or contain
long hearts instead.  This treatment is inspired by Twisted 2/1 by Ting-Yu Ye
(TpKotoba).  I untwist the 2/1 bids but keep weak hearts in 2!c.

1S-2C-
2D = !(R), 0--2!h or 5+!h
2H = MIN, 2--3!h
2S = MIN, 6+!s
2N = BAL MAX, 3=!h
3C = MAX, 4+!c, 3=!h
3D = MAX, 4+!d, 3=!h
3H = MIN, 4=!h
3S = MAX, 6+!s, 3=!h
3N = MAX, 4=!h

1S-2D-
2H = MIN, 4+!h
2S = MIN, 0--3!h
2N = !MAX, 3=!h
3C = MAX, 4+!c, 0--2!h
3D = MAX, 4+!d, 0--2!h

3N = MAX, 5233

Note that we use difference 4-card raising structures for 1!h and 1!s.  Our
spade raises cover all mini-Splinters and a mixed raise.  On the other hand, we
use reverse Bergen raises for hearts for several reasons:

1. We have more preemptive uses for 1!h-2!s such as invitational both minors or
   a weak jump shift.
2. As a corollary, we don't have enough room to discriminate all mini-Splinters.
3. We need 1!h-3!h to preempt a potential spade fit while 1!s-2!s is usually
   enough for a heart fit.

1S-3C-
3D = INV, decline a !d SPL
3H = INV, decline a !h SPL

1S-3D-
3H = F1, 4+!h

** Natural invitational 2/1 by passed hand

We don't play Drury here.  For a 3-card limit raise without a 5-card side suit,
1NT is decent.

#SEAT 34

1H-
2C = INV, 5+!c
2D = INV, 5+!d

1S-
2C = INV, 5+!c
2D = INV, 5+!d
2H = INV, 5+!h

#SEAT 0

** Competitive bidding

We play transfers over 1M-(Dbl) as suggested by /Polish Club 2020: Expert./

- *From 1NT to 2M-1*: transfers
- *Simple raise*: constructive raise
- *Other bids*: same as uncontested
