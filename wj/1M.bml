* Major suit openings

1H-
1S = F, 4+!s, 5+ HCP
1N = NF, 0--3!h, 7--11 HCP
2C = FG, 4+!c or STR 3433
2D = FG, 4+!d
2H = 3+!h, 8.5--9.5 NLTC
2S = !INV, (54)+ in minors, 9--11 HCP
2N = !FG, 4+!h
3C = !INV, 4+!h
3D = !CONST, 4+!h
3H = !PRE, 4+!h
3S = !FG SPL, 0--1!s, 4+!h
3N = !Choice of games, 33(43), 12--15 HCP
4C = !FG SPL, 0--1!c, 4+!h
4D = !FG SPL, 0--1!d, 4+!h
4H = PRE, 4+!h

We swap 2!c and 2!h over 1!s, inspired by Twisted 2/1 by Ting-Yu Ye (TpKotoba).

1S-
1N = NF, 0--3!s, 7--11 HCP
2C = ! 5+!h 7+ HCP or FG 4+!h, but not INV 5!h
2D = FG, 4+!d or STR 4333
2H = !FG, 4+!c
2S = 3+!s, 8.5--9.5 NLTC
2N = !FG, 4+!s
3C = !INV or S/T, 0--1!d or 0--1!h, 4+!s
3D = !INV or S/T, 0--1!c, 4+!s
3H = !INV or S/T, 4+!s
3S = !CONST, 4+!s
3N = !Choice of games, 3(433), 12--15 HCP
4X = !FG SPL, 0--1#, 4+!s
4S = PRE, 4+!s

1S-2C-
2D = !(R), MIN 5!s 0--1!h or MAX 3+!h
2H = MIN, 2--3!h
2S = MIN, 6+!s
2N = MAX, 5233
3C = MAX, 4+!c
3D = MAX, 4+!d
3H = MIN, 4+!h
3S = MAX, 6+!s

Note that we use difference 4-card raising structures for 1!h and 1!s.  Our
spade raises cover all mini-Splinters and a mixed raise.  On the other hand, we
use reverse Bergen raises for hearts for several reasons:

1. We have more preemptive uses for 1!h-2!s such as invitational both minors or
   a weak jump shift.
2. As a corollary, we don't have enough room to discriminate all mini-Splinters.
3. We need 1!h-3!h to preempt a potential spade fit while 1!s-2!s is usually
   enough for a heart fit.

1S-3C-
3D = INV, decline a !d SPL
3H = INV, decline a !h SPL

1S-3D-
3H = F1, 4+!h

** Natural invitational 2/1 by passed hand

We don't play Drury here.  For a 3-card limit raise without a 5-card side suit,
1NT is decent.

#SEAT 34

1H-
2C = INV, 5+!c
2D = INV, 5+!d

1S-
2C = INV, 5+!c
2D = INV, 5+!d
2H = INV, 5+!h

#SEAT 0

** Competitive bidding

We play transfers over 1M-(Dbl) as suggested by /Polish Club 2020: Expert./

- *From 1NT to 2M-1*: transfers
- *Simple raise*: constructive raise
- *Other bids*: same as uncontested
