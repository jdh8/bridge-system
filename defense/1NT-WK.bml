* Over weak notrump

We play Landy against a weak notrump.  We consider a natural notrump opening
weak if more than half of the hands contain 14 or fewer HCP.  This simple
defense undermines their /systems on/ approach over (1NT)-2!c.  Meanwhile, we
still threat to stop in our natural 2!d.

(1N)-
D  = PEN, 14+ HCP
2C = !Landy, 4+!s, 4+!h, 12--17 HCP
2X = 5+#, 12--17 HCP

By passed hand, we play the defense against a strong notrump.
