** Reverse Lebensohl

Though usually treated the same, there is a significant difference between
(2X)-Dbl and 1NT-(2X): we cannot pass boring hands in the former situation!
After a long discussion, we came to a conclusion that reverse Lebensohl with
Rubens advances is a better alternative than transfer or standard counterparts.

As opposed to the standard/original Lebensohl, this 2NT relay handles
constructive hands (8+ HCP or 7+ HCP by passed hand) while directly bidding a
suit below 3X is weak.  Since an in-shape takeout is short in the adverse suit,
advancer is more likely to have a stopper.  Inviting with 2NT right-sides the
contract more often than not.

There are subtle differences among adverse suits.  We adjust them case by
case.

Note that this structure also works for artificial (2m) openings without
further modification.
