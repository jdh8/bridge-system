* Over natural (1X)

(1Y)-
D  = T/O, 13+ points
1Z = NAT, 9--17 points, usually 5+#
1N = NAT, 15--17 HCP with stopper
2X = NAT, 12--17 points, 5+#
2Z = PRE, 4--10 HCP, 6+#
2N = !UNT, 5+ 5+ in lowest two unbid suits
3X = PRE, 5--9 HCP, usually 7+#
3Y = !Gambling, SOL 7+ suit without stopper
3Z = PRE, 5--9 HCP, usually 7+#
3N = !Gambling, SOL 7+ suit with stopper

(1C)-
2C = !Landy, 4+!s, 4+!h
  2D = !Equal preference

(1D)-
2D = !Michaels, 4+!s, 5+!h

(1H)-
2H = !Michaels, 5+!s, 4+m

(1S)-
2S = !Michaels, 5+!h, 5+m

Due to insufficient strength, 1NT by passed hand becomes unusual.

(1X)-
1N = !UNT, 4+ 4+ in lowest two unbid suits

#SEAT 0

** Balancing overcall

Different from a direct overcall, a simple balancing overcall is tentative,
while a jump overcall is sound.

(1Y)-P-
D  = T/O, 8+ HCP
1Z = NAT, 8--15 HCP, 4+#
2X = NAT, 8--15 HCP, 5+#
2Z = NAT, 11--15 HCP, 6+#
3X = NAT, 11--15 HCP, 6+#

*** Notrump overcalls

#SEAT 1

By unpassed hand, notrump overcalls are natural because we want a sound 2NT.

- 13--15 HCP: 1NT
- 16--18 HCP: X, then notrump
- 19--21 HCP: 2NT

(1X)-P-
1N = 13--15 HCP with stopper
2N = 19--21 HCP with stopper

#SEAT 0

Like a direct overcall, 1NT by passed hand is unusual.

(1X)-P-
1N = !UNT, 4+ 4+ in lowest two unbid suits

** Advances to (1X)-1Y

Raises are natural and non-forcing.  Note that the overcall occasionally
contains only 4 cards.  We always raise to the 3-level with 4+ trumps.

Z, a suit higher than Y, is always a major suit.  Bidding 1Z is forcing for
constructiveness. Jump advances in Z are preemptive.

Notrump advances are natural in the sense of showing length or a stopper in the
adverse suit.

(1X)-1Y-
1Z = F, 4+#, usually 8+ HCP
1N = NAT, 9--12 HCP
2Y = CONST, 3+#
2Z = PRE, 6+#
2N = NAT INV, 13--15 HCP
3Y = PRE, 4+#

Let's reword the auction as (1Y)-1Z to discuss X, a suit lower than Y. X is
always a minor suit.  We are more interested in 3NT than a minor suit game.
Therefore, we bear the presence of a stopper in mind.  Sometimes we have to bid
a 4-card 2X because we lack a stopper to bid notrump.

Aggressor still has the chance to query a stopper with a cuebid.  That is why we
can bid fairly naturally here.

(1Y)-1Z-
2X = F unless by PH, 9+ HCP, usually 5+#
3X = INV, 6+#

The other suits are Rubens advances.  Cuebids and suits in between are
transfers.  After rephrasing the auction as (1X)-1Z, Y is a suit in between.
There is no distinction between X and Y.  Transfer supports are special
nevertheless.

- *4steps = 2Z − 1*: limit raise or better, 3+ support
- *9steps = 3Z − 1*: mixed raise, 4+ support
- *Other 2XY*: 9+ HCP, usually 5+ cards
- *Other 3XY*: Invitation with 6+ cards, usually without a stopper

Despite that we have skipped the cuebid, aggressor can dissuade further
investigation by simply accepting the transfer.

(1X)-1Z-
4steps = !TRF LIM+, 3+ support
9steps = !TRF CONST, 4+ support
2X = !TRF, 9+ HCP, usually 5+ cards
2Y = !TRF, 9+ HCP, usually 5+ cards
3X = !INV, 6+ cards, usually without a stopper
3Y = !INV, 6+ cards, usually without a stopper

** Advances to (1X)-1NT

(1X)-1N-
2N = NAT INV
3N = S/O
4N = QUANT INV to 6NT
5N = QUANT INV to 7NT

2H = !TRF, 5+!s

3C = !FG, 5+om, 5+M
