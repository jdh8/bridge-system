* Ekren 2!c

Ekren is an artificial preempt showing 4+ cards in each major.  This preempt is
not only frequent (5--6%) but also frees major preempts from the other major.
Ekren is slightly less frequent than a wild 5-card natural preempt (6--7%) but
much more frequent than a traditional 6-card preempt (2.2--2.7%).

Ekren is originally at 2!d.  We move it to 2!c to fill in the removed
/Precision/ and leave space for Multi.

Unlike natural preempts, we have 2NT as a nonforcing natural invitation.  Since
Ekren hands can be fairly balanced, 2NT can be the sweet spot on misfit.
