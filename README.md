Bidding Markup Language (BML).  Please use [my fork][fork] for now until

Pill bidding systems
----------------------
My pet forcing club bidding systems.  I believe bidding 1â™£ for all strong hands
is a superior treatment.  The color of a pill corresponds to its WBF colored
sticker before 2023.

- [Redpill Polish Club](https://jdh8.github.io/bridge-systems/redpill.htm) ðŸ”´ ðŸ’Š ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±
- [Bluepill Club](https://jdh8.github.io/bridge-systems/bluepill.htm) ðŸ”µ ðŸ’Š ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹
- [Defensive bidding system](https://jdh8.github.io/bridge-systems/defense.htm) ðŸ›¡

[As of 2023, WBF updated their policy.][stickers]  Polish Club is now a blue
sticker system.  This change breaks the play on the [red pill and bluepill][pills].
However, I am glad that Polish Club is more widely accepted now.
