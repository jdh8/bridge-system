** Hand evaluation

- *High card points (HCP)*: the well-known Milton Work's 4321 count
- *Total points*: HCP + distribution points (void = 3, singleton = 2, doubleton
  = 1, subtract 1 for each short suit with HCP)
- *Zar points (ZP)*: 6-4-2-1 + Zar distribution points (a + b + a - d, where the
  letters are the number of cards from the longest to the shortest suit)
- *Fifths*: 4.0--2.8--1.8--1.0--0.4, adjusted HCP for notrump contracts
  especially 3NT
- *BUM-RAP*: 4.5--3--1.5--0.75--0.25, adjusted HCP for suit contracts
- *NLTC*: Count 1.5--1.0--0.5 losers for each missing AKQ

NLTC is a good single hand evaluator but not very additive.  It suits
preemptive initial actions but not for showing supports.  I have a blog article
on that topic.

*** Stopper

We evaluate stopper quality as GIB does.

- *Partial stop*: length + HCP = 4
- *Likely stop*: length + HCP = 5
- *Stop*: A, QJx, or length + HCP at least 7
- *Two stops*: length + HCP at least 8
