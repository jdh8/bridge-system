* Ekren 2!d

Ekren is an artificial preempt showing 4+ cards in each major.  This preempt is
not only frequent (5--6%) but also frees major preempts from the other major.
Ekren is slightly less frequent than a wild 5-card natural preempt (6--7%) but
much more frequent than a traditional 6-card preempt (2.2--2.7%).

Unlike natural preempts, we have 2NT as a non-forcing natural invitation.  Since
Ekren hands can be fairly balanced, 2NT can be the sweet spot on misfit.

On the other hand, we have 3!c/!d as !s/!h invitations respectively.  Note the
interchange that allows finding any 5-3 major fit.  Bo-Yin Yang conceived this
interchanged South African transfer in 2000.
