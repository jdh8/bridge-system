* Strong notrump opening

We use the American-style 4-way transfers with an adjunct.  We also transfer
balanced invitational hands at 2!s.  We bid 3!c instead with invitational 6+!c.

The responder tries to show a major first always (MAFIA).  The only exception
is not to bid Stayman with (4333), a hand so flat that playing notrump is a
better idea.

1N-
2C = !STAY, may be Garbage
2D = !TRF, 5+!h
2H = !TRF, 5+!s
2S = !TRF, 6+!c or BAL INV
2N = !TRF, 6+!d
3C = INV, 6+!c
3D = !FRAG, 0--1!h, 2--3!s, 4--5!d, 4--5!c
3H = !FRAG, 0--1!s, 2--3!h, 4--5!d, 4--5!c
3S = !Choice of games, 5+!s, 5+!h
3N = S/O
4C = !Gerber, ask for aces
  4D = ! 0 or 4 aces
  4H = ! 1 ace
  4S = ! 2 aces
  4N = ! 3 aces
4D = !Texas TRF, 6+!h
4H = !Texas TRF, 6+!s
4S = !FG, 5+!d, 5+!c
4N = QUANT INV to 6NT
5N = QUANT INV to 7NT

** Stayman

Excluding opener's 5-card majors, the Stayman has its traditional meaning or a
Garbage Stayman.

- INV+, unspecified 4+M
- WK, 4!s, 4!h, 4--5!d, 0--1!c

1N-2C-
2D = ! 2--3!s, 2--3!h
2H = 4!h
2S = 4!s, 2--3!h

The Garbage Stayman takes advantage of that opener will eventually rebid within
2!s!h!d, so we can bid 2!c as a weak takeout of clubs and pass in the next round.

1N-2C-2X-
P  = WK, 4!s, 4!h, 4--5!d, 0--1!c

We only employ Smolen transfers at the 3-level.  The 2-level invitations are
natrual so that we have a chance to stop at 2!h.

1N-2C-2D-
2H = INV, 5+!h, 4+!s
2S = INV, 5+!s, 4+!h
2N = INV
3C = FG, 5+!c
3D = FG, 5+!d
3H = !FG, Smolen TRF, 54(xx)
3S = !FG, Smolen TRF, 45(xx)
3N = S/O
4C = !Gerber, ask for aces
4D = !Texas TRF, 6+!h, 4+!s
4H = !Texas TRF, 6+!s, 4+!h
4N = QUANT INV to 6NT
5N = QUANT INV to 7NT

The step of 1NT-2!c-2!h-2!s allows us to always choose the better major fit.
This is why the opener rebids 2!h with 44 majors.

1N-2C-2H-
2S = F2NT, 5+!s, 4+!h
2N = INV, 0--3!h, 4!s

4D = !S/T SPL, 0--1!d, 4+!h
4H = S/O, 4+!h

3N = S/O, 0--3!s, 4!h
4C = !S/T SPL, 0--1!c, 4+!s
4D = !S/T SPL, 0--1!d, 4+!s
4S = S/O, 4+!s
4N = QUANT INV to 6NT, 0--3!s
5N = QUANT INV to 7NT, 0--3!s

** Jacoby transfer

The opener always accepts Jacoby transfers.  We super-accept with maximum and 4
trumps.  We /hide/ the doubleton just below the trump to avoid retransferring
problems like 1NT-2!d-3!d!-3!h?.

** Seeking a major fit

There are apparent overlaps between major fit seeking conventions, especially
Jacoby transfers with Stayman or Texas transfers.  This section describes how
to pick the best response.

*** Major two suiter, (54)+

To find the better fit, we consider the length difference between majors in our
partnership.  The opener's difference is at most 2, so our basic strategy is

- *Same lengths*: let partner decide
- *Difference 1--2*: proactive negotiation
- *Difference > 2*: ignore the shorter suit

However, with a weak hand, it is more important to keep the bidding low.  We
transfer to our longer major and then pass.

**** Same lengths, 55+

We choose the hearts from a weak two suiter for a chance to run out to 2!s
unless spades are sufficiently better.

- *Weak* = 2!d (→!h); then pass
- *Invitational* = 2!d (→!h); then 2!s
- *Choice of games* = 3!s
- *Forcing to game* = 2!h (→!s); then 3!h

**** Difference 1--2, (54)+

- *Weak* = transfer to the longer major
- *Invitational+* = Stayman

*** Major single suiter, 6+

- *Weak* = Jacoby; then pass
- *Invitational* = Jacoby; then 3M
- *Game but no slam* = Texas; then pass
- *Mild slam interest* = Jacoby; then 4M
- *Strong slam try* = Texas; keep bidding

** Minor transfer

We use fragment bids instead of Splinters here to avoid lead-directing doubles.

1N-2S-
2N = !MIN
  3C = S/O
  3D = !FRAG, 0--1!s, 6+!c
  3H = !FRAG, 0--1!d, 6+!c
  3S = !FRAG, 0--1!h, 6+!c
  4S = !Retransfer, 6+!c
3C = !MAX
  3D = !FRAG, 0--1!s, 6+!c
  3H = !FRAG, 0--1!d, 6+!c
  3S = !FRAG, 0--1!h, 6+!c
  4S = !Retransfer, 6+!c
3D = !MAX, 4+!c

1N-2N-
3C = !MIN
  3D = S/O
  3H = !FRAG, 0--1!s
  3S = !FRAG, 0--1!h
  5C = !Retransfer
3D = !MAX
  3H = !FRAG, 0--1!s
  3S = !FRAG, 0--1!h
  5C = !Retransfer
3H = !MAX, 4+!d

We move the minor Stayman to the unallocated 4!s.  Since the opener must have a
3+ card minor, 55 minors would ensure a minor fit.  The opener rebids based on
suit preference.

1N-4S-
4N = !Equal preference
5m = To play

** Competitive bidding

Competition does not affect auctions at 3NT and above.

1N-(2X)-
3N = S/O
4C = !Gerber, ask for aces
4D = !Texas TRF, 6+!h
4H = !Texas TRF, 6+!s
4S = !FG, 5+!d, 5+!c

*** Over (Dbl)

We keep things simple over a strong double (10+ HCP).  Everything is natural.

1N-(D)-
R  = INV+
2X = 5+#

*** Over (2!c)

We play /systems on/ over 1NT-(2!c).  Most bids keep the same meaning.  This is
because 2!c is so low that we can treat it as (mirrored) (1!c)-1NT.

- If there is no anchor suit, we completely ignore the 2!c bid.
- With one anchor suit X, we treat it as (1X)-1NT, where /systems on/ also
applies.
- With a major and a minor anchor suits, we ignore the minor suit.

1N-(2C)-
D  = !STAY, may be Garbage
2D = !TRF, 5+!h
2H = !TRF, 5+!s
2S = !TRF, 6+!c or BAL INV
2N = !TRF, 6+!d

We recommend Leaping Michaels over a sole anchor suit.  Take natural clubs for
example.

1N-(2C)-
3C = !INV+, 6+!d, at most partial stop in !c
3D = !FG, 5+!s, 5+!h
3H = !FG, 5+!h, 5+!d
3S = !FG, 5+!s, 5+!d

The real headache is when (2!c) shows both majors e.g. Landy.  We recommend
reverse unusual vs. unusual.

1N-(2C)-
D  = Suggest penalizing either major
2D = To play, 5+!d
2H = !INV+, 5+!d
2S = !INV+, 5+!c
2N = !INV+, 4+!d, 5+!c
3C = To play, 6+!c
3D = To play, 6+!d
3H = !Ask for !h stopper
3S = !Ask for !s stopper

Note that we pass when we can penalize both majors.  A delayed double is for
penalty since a takeout can usually penalize the other major.

*** Over (2!d!h!s)

We play Transfer Lebensohl against overcalls 2!d!h!s.

1N-(2D)-
D  = !OPT, BAL INV
2M = S/O, 5+#

    3N = !FG, 5+!c, likely stop in !d
  3D = !NF, 5+!c
3C = !FG STAY
3D = !TRF, INV+, 5+!h
3H = !TRF, INV+, 5+!s

3H = !FG STAY, 4+!h
3S = !FG, usually short !s
3N = S/O, likely stop in !s

*** Over (2NT)

We have a special unusual vs. unusual structure over 1NT-(2NT) because we have
not yet shown a suit.

1N-(2N)-
D  = INV+, 2--4!s, 2--4!h, 2+!d, 2+!c
