#+DESCRIPTION: My pet Polish Club bidding system

* Litten Polish Club

Welcome to Litten Polish Club!  Polish Club is a 5-card major small club
bidding system, where the 1!c opening is forcing but not necessarily strong.
Notably, *we swap the natural suits between 1!c and 1!d* by courtesy of Ting-Yu
Ye (TpKotoba).  In other words, 1!d shows clubs, and 1!c has various options
including a diamond suit.

This bidding system is also based on /Polish Club 2020: Expert./  Changes
are made with /Good, Better, Best/ and my improvisation.

** Why Polish Club?

Simulations in /Good, Better, Best/ show that forcing club systems tend to
outperform other systems.  Polish Club serves as a gateway to the world of
forcing clubs.  It is 5-card major.  Its main opening range is 12--17 HCP.
Sharing these properties, it has similar bidding structure to 2/1, the lingua
franca of modern bridge.

** Notable differences from /Polish Club 2020: Expert/

*** Constructive auctions

- The 2/1 responses to 1!s are natural or contain hearts instead.
  (Untwisted 2/1)
- After 1M, we have 4-card support step responses from 2NT to 3M.
- In our BTU XYZ 3-way checkback, the 2!c relay contains 2-level
  signoffs like Gladiator.

*** Preempts

- We modified continuations after the 2X preempts.
- BTU Namyats replace natural 4m.

*** Slam try

- We use kickback RKCB 0314 for all suits.
- When we have found two fits X and Y, 4Y+1 is 7-key Blackwood (7KCB), RKCB in
  both suits with each trump Q regarded as half a keycard.
- New suits above RKCB are control asking RKCB.  Return to 5X if you lack a
  control in that suit.  Otherwise, use the other steps like RKCB.
- We also suggest using the non-serious 3NT, Optional Minorwood, and Last Train
  in slam tries.
