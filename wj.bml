#+DESCRIPTION: My pet Polish Club bidding system

* Litten Polish Club

Welcome to Litten Polish Club!  Polish Club is a 5-card major small club
bidding system, where the 1!c opening is forcing but not necessarily strong.
Notably, *we swap the natural suits between 1!c and 1!d* by courtesy of Ting-Yu
Ye (TpKotoba).  In other words, 1!d shows clubs, and 1!c has various options
including a diamond suit.

This bidding system is also based on /Polish Club 2020: Expert./  Changes
are made with /Good, Better, Best/ and my improvisation.

We use the distribution syntax and abbreviations provided by WBF.

** Notable differences from /Polish Club 2020: Expert/

*** Constructive auctions

- The minor suit interchange: we open 1!d for clubs!
- We use natural 2/1 after 1!h and swapped 2/1 after 1!s.
- After 1M, we have 4-card support step responses from 2NT to 3M.
- In our 3-way checkback over 1X-1M-1NT, the 2!c relay contains 2-level
  signoffs like Gladiator.

*** Preempts

- We modified continuations after the 2X preempts.
- BTU Namyats replace natural 4m.

*** Slam try

- We use kickback RKCB 0314 for all suits.
- When we have found two fits X and Y, 4Y+1 is RKCB in both suits.  We regard
  each trump Q as half a keycard in double RKCB.
- New suits above RKCB are control asking RKCB.  Return to 5X if you lack a
  control in that suit.  Otherwise, use the other steps like RKCB.
- We also suggest using the non-serious 3NT, Optional Minorwood, and Last Train
  in slam tries.

* Opening bids

We have the minor suit interchange here.  This treatment fixes several problems
such as rebidding clubs over 1!c.  This treatment also introduces lesser
problems, but I believe they can be solved by further adjustments.

1C = !F:
     (a) 12--14 HCP, 2--4!s, 2--4!h, 2--4!d, 2--4!c
     (b) 11--17 HCP, 5+!d or 4441
     (c) 18+ HCP
1D = !TRF, 11--17 HCP, 5+!c or (441)4
1H = 11--17 HCP, 5+!h
1S = 11--17 HCP, 5+!s
1N = 15--17 HCP, 2--4!s, 2--4!h, 2--6!d, 2--6!c
2C = !PRE, 4--10 HCP, 4+!s, 4+!h
2D = !PRE, 4--10 HCP, 6+M, 
2M = PRE, 4--10 HCP, 5=#, 4+m, 
2N = !UNT, 4--10 HCP, 5+!d, 5+!c
3X = PRE, 4--10 HCP, 7+#
3N = !Gambling, SOL 7+m, 0--1 outside A/K
4C = !PRE, S-SOL 8+M, 0--1 outside A/K
4D = !PRE, SOL 8+M, no outside A/K
4M = PRE, 8+#
4N = !UNT, 11--15 HCP, 6+!d, 6+!c

** The notrump ladder

- *12--14*: 1!c-1!d-1M
- *15--17*: 1NT
- *18--20*: 1!c-1!d-1NT
- *21--23*: 1!c-1!d-2NT
- *24+*: 1!c-1!d-2!d-2!h-2NT
