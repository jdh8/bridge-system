#+DESCRIPTION: My pet Blue Club bidding system

* Introduction

Welcome to Bluepill Club!  This bidding system is largely based on Cottontail
Club in /Good, Better, Best/ by Jan Eric Larsson, which in turn descends from
Blue Club.  Changes are made with my improvisation.

We use the distribution syntax and abbreviations provided by WBF.

** Choice of suit openings

Contrary to popular belief, a modern Blue Club is pretty natural.

- Bid the longest suit
- Bid the higher-ranking suit but choose 1!h for 44 in majors

*** Canapé

Sometimes we open the secondary suit on purpose.

We try to skip minimum 5-card clubs.  For (4xx)5 and 12--14 HCP, open the
4-carder instead.

We also canapé for strong two suiters, planning to reverse in the primary suit
later.

- 15--16 HCP
- At least (54) in two of !s!h!d

** The notrump ladder

- *12--14*: 1!d!h!s or 2!c
- *15--17*: 1NT
- *18--20*: 1!c-1!d-1NT
- *21--23*: 1!c-1!d-2NT
- *24--27*: 1!c-1!d-3NT
- *28--30*: 1!c-1!d-4NT
